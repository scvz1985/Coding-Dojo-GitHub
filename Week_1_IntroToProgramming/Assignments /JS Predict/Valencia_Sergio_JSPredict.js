//Predict 1
function myBirthYearFunc(){
    console.log("I was born in" + 1989);
}
myBirthYearFunc();

//Whenever the year is enter, message will appear with the "I was born in ####"
//Predict 2:
functio myBirthYearFunc (birthYearInput){
    console.log("I was born in" + birthYearInput);
}
myBirthYearFunc(1980);
//console.log would most likely show "I was born in the year 1980" since its called to have first part of the message
//and the input year. Much like a confirmation of whatever year was input.
//Predict 3:
function add(num1, num2){
    console.log("Summing Numbers!");
    console.log("num1 is: " + num!);
    console.log("num2 is: " + num2);
var sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum)
}
add(10,20);
//I beleive that were going to get one message that says Summing Numbers! Next one will be one that states that the
//first num is 10. Next message will say that num2 is 20. We'll then get a message stating that the sum of both is 30.
